# Debugging the Elastic-Agent

The Elastic-Agent is a bit trickier to debug as it's basically never run it directly, most of the
time it's installed and a system service is registered to run it. Besides, it also starts several
other applications, mainly the Beats. This how-to shows how to remotely debug an elastic-agent
or beats running on another machine.

## In a hurry? Go to [tl;dr](#tl;dr)

## Requirements

To remote debug we'll need:
- [Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve)
- Any Delve [frontend client](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/blob/master/Documentation/EditorIntegration.md).
  Delve already comes with a terminal client and your IDE is likely one as well.

To follow along, you'll also need:
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

## What we'll do

- compile the elastic-agent (and optionally the beats) to allow debugging
- start a Vagrant VM. Delve will already be installed there :)
- install and enroll the elastic-agent on this VM
- spin up a Delve backend server connected to the running elastic-agent on the VM
- use Delve's terminal client to connect to the Delve server on the VM
- set up a breakpoint
- make the elastic-agent to hit the breakpoint

## Compile the Elastic-Agent for debug

It's necessary to compile the elastic-agent with the [`DEV=true`](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/blob/main/dev-tools/mage/build.go#L54)
to add the debug symbols and disable optimisations. Setting `SNAPSHOT=true` so the
agent will skip signature verification of the
binaries it runs as well as will download them from the snapshop artifacts API.

Set `PLATFORMS` and `PACKAGES` environment variables to match yours or the target system.
Use `EXTERNAL=true` if you do not want to compile the beats, downloading them instead.

TODO: check if the SNAPSHOT builds are build with `DEV=true`, if not, make so.

On the elastic-agent's repo root run:
```shell
DEV=true SNAPSHOT=true EXTERNAL=true PLATFORMS="linux/amd64" PACKAGES="tar.gz" mage -v clean package
```
the elastic-agent artifact will be placed on `build/distributions`.

### Elastic Stack

In order to enroll an elastic-agent with Fleet a Elastic Stack is needed. The
easiest way is to spin up one on [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co).
<!-- TODO: Anyway
[`elastic-package`](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-package/releases) works too.
The elastic-package uses docker and docker compose to spin up the stack.


I haven't managed to use elastic-package for the stack and a VM to install the
elastic-agent as right now elastic-package creates the stack using the docker internal DNS,
http://elasticsearch:9200' and http://fleet-server:8220, and the elastic-agent seems to not be able
to correctly override them. Also Kibana does not accept to [edit those](http://localhost:5601/app/fleet/settings)
as it rejects HTTP, accepting only HTTPS. :(
Editing `/etc/hosts` on the VM to map `fleet-server/elasticsearch` to their IPs is an option.

Download and run `elastic-package` on your machine:

```shell
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elastic-package/releases/latest \
| grep "browser_download_url.*linux_amd64.tar.gz" \
| cut -d : -f 2,3 \
| tr -d \" \
| wget -i -
tar -xf elastic-package*.tar.gz

eval "$(elastic-package stack shellinit)"
./elastic-package stack up --version 8.3.0-SNAPSHOT
```

Kibana will be available on [localhost:5601](localhost:5601). The default credencials are:
> username: elastic
> password: changeme

If you're using `elastic-package`, you'll need to determine the IP of the fleet-server
container.

```shell
docker ps
# look for elastic-package-stack_fleet-server_1 or something similar
# CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                                           COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS                  PORTS                                NAMES
# 860c517bdd66   docker.elastic.co/beats/elastic-agent-complete:8.3.0-SNAPSHOT   "/usr/bin/tini -- /uâ€¦"   17 hours ago   Up 17 hours (healthy)   127.0.0.1:8220->8220/tcp             elastic-package-stack_fleet-server_1
docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' CONTAINER_ID # this will output the container IP
```
-->

## Spin up a VM using Vagrant

There is a [Vagrantfile](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/blob/main/Vagrantfile)
on the repository root. A `dev` VM is defined there, it forwards the port `4242` to
the hosts `4242` port and mounts the repository's root to `/vagrant`.

To spin up and connect to the VM:

```shell
vagrant up dev
vagrant ssh dev
```

It can be destroyed with:
```shell
vagrant destroy dev
```

## Delve, the debugger

There are several options to [invoke Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/blob/master/Documentation/usage/dlv.md)
to debug a program. In short
```shell
dlv <delve flags> <delve command> <target to debug> -- <args to the target>
# Eg:
dlv --headless=true exec ./elastic-agnet -- diagnostics collect
```

### Remote debug

In order to remote debug an application we need 3 things:
- the process we want to debug
- a Delve instance running as a server:
  - it'll attach or run the process we want to debug
- a frontend client, which will connect to the Delve server.
  - Usually your IDE can connect directly to the Delve server

### Delve backend server

In order to run Delve as a backend server the `--headless` cli flag is used.
It can be used with any command (`debug`, `test`, `exec`, `attach`, `core` or `replay`).
Therefore we can either attach to a running process (`dlv attach`) or start it
through Delve (`dlv exec|debug`).

As the elastic-agent and beats are already running, we'll attach to them with:
```shell
dlv --listen=:4242 --headless=true --api-version=2 --accept-multiclient attach PID
```
where:
- `--listen=:4242`: server address, here we're just passing in the port `4242`
- `--headless=true`: run only the server, in headless mode
- `--api-version=2`: defines the JSON-RPC API version
- `--accept-multiclient`: allows multiple client connections

### Client connecting to the Delve server

There are several options for [frontend clients](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/blob/master/Documentation/EditorIntegration.md). [Goland](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/attach-to-running-go-processes-with-debugger.html#step-3-create-the-remote-run-debug-configuration-on-the-client-computer),
[VS Code](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/debugging.md#launchjson-attributes) and [Emacs](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/dap-mode/page/configuration/#go) all have plugins for Delve.

#### Delve terminal client

For the sake of keeping this guide generic, let's use Delve terminal client.
If you followed along up to here, you should have a Vagrant box that:
- forwards its port 4242 to you your localhost:4242
- has an elastic-agent running
- has a Delve server attached to the running elastic agent listening on port 4242

Now you can connect to the remote Delve server using Delve's terminal client. Let's
do it, set a breakpoint and see it all working.

We'll set a breakpoint on the
elastic-agent's `status` command, so we can easily hit this breakpoint whenever
we want. By the time this guide was written the code for the status command was
located on [internal/pkg/agent/control/server/server.go:152](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/blob/main/internal/pkg/agent/control/server/server.go#L152).

- On the host (a.k.a your machine)
```shell
dlv connect localhost:4242
# it'll open Delve's console
b internal/pkg/agent/control/server/server.go:152 # sets the breakpoint
c # continues the execution until the code hits any breakpoint
```

- On the VM
```shell
sudo /opt/Elastic/Agent/elastic-agent status
```
You should see Delve stopping on the breakpoint. \o/ it works!


## tl;dr

Have your [elastic-stack](#elastic-stack) ready.

### On your machine
```shell
cd /path/to/your/elastic-agent/repo
# Omit EXTERNAL=true to compile the beats as well
DEV=true SNAPSHOT=true EXTERNAL=true PLATFORMS="linux/amd64" PACKAGES="tar.gz" mage -v clean package
vagrant up dev
vagrant ssh dev
```

### On the Vagrant machine

```shell
sudo -i # it's easier to be root as you'll need root permissions to interact with the elastic-agent
rm -rf elastic-agent* && \
cp /vagrant/build/distributions/elastic-agent-*.tar.gz ./ && \
mkdir -p elastic-agent && \
tar --strip-components=1 -xf elastic-agent-*.tar.gz -C elastic-agent && \
cd elastic-agent
# Install and enroll the elastic agent (or run stand alone)
# --non-interactive: not prompt for confirmation
# --force: replaces a previously installed elastic-agent if any is present
# --insecure: allows HTTP for fleet-server endpoint
./elastic-agent install --non-interactive --force --insecure --url=SOME_URL --enrollment-token=SOME_TOKEN
```

<!--
TODO:
sudo ./elastic-agent install --non-interactive --force --insecure \
 --fleet-server-host=http://172.18.0.6 \
 --fleet-server-port=8220
-->

- find the process PID to connect to
```shell
ps aux | grep elastic-agent # or filebeat, metricbeat, ...
```
```shell
root@ubuntu-impish:~# ps aux | grep elastic-agent
root       24953  0.7  3.0 1799448 62296 ?       Ssl  08:29   0:05 /opt/Elastic/Agent/elastic-agent
root        8891  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        Zs   12:59   0:00 [elastic-agent] <defunct>
root        8916  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        Zs   12:59   0:00 [elastic-agent] <defunct>
```

Ignore any `[elastic-agent] <defunct>`, we want the `/opt/Elastic/Agent/elastic-agent`,
here it's PID 24953.
Now that we now the PID, we can attach Delve to it:

```shell
dlv --listen=:4242 --headless=true --api-version=2 --accept-multiclient attach 24953
```

### Back to your machine

```shell
dlv connect localhost:4242
# it'll open Delve's console
b internal/pkg/agent/control/server/server.go:152 # sets the breakpoint
c # continues the execution until the code hits any breakpoint
```

- on another terminal:
```shell
vagrant ssh dev
```

### On the new session on the VM

```shell
sudo /opt/Elastic/Agent/elastic-agent status
```


## Troubleshooting

### (dlv) no such file or directory
Probably the source code path at compile time differs from the one you have.
Use [`config substitute-path`](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/Documentation/cli#config) to
adjust it. The error below

```text
> github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/internal/pkg/agent/control/server.(*Server).ProcMeta() /go/src/github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/internal/pkg/agent/control/server/server.go:240 (hits goroutine(894):1 total:1) (PC: 0x56424d219d19)
Command failed: open /go/src/github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/internal/pkg/agent/control/server/server.go: no such file or directory
```
can be fixed with

```text
(dlv) config substitute-path /go/src/github.com/elastic/elastic-agent /vagrant
```

### (dlv) Warning: debugging optimized function

Ensure optimizations and inlining are disabled. Build the elastic-agent and beats with
`DEV=true` so `-gcflags=all=-N -l` will be passed to the Go compiler.
